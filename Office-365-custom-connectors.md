# Manage Microsoft 365 connectors and custom connectors

Connectors in Microsoft Teams deliver content and service updates directly from third-party services into a Teams channel. Using connectors, the users receive updates from popular services such as Trello, Wunderlist, GitHub, and Azure DevOps Services. The updates are posted directly into the chat stream. This functionality makes it easy for all the team members to stay in sync and quickly receive the relevant information.

Microsoft 365 connectors are used with both Teams and Microsoft 365 groups. You can use the same connectors in Teams and Microsoft Exchange.

<!--- However, if you disable any connectors configured for a Microsoft 365 group, it also disables the ability for the Microsoft 365 group to create connectors. --->

If the team permissions allow a connector to be added to a team, any member of a team can add a connector. All team members are notified of updates from the service that the connector fetches information from. Any team member with the permissions to add or remove can modify connectors setup done by other members.

## Enable or disable connectors in Teams

The Exchange Online PowerShell v2 module uses modern authentication and works with multi-factor authentication (MFA) to connect to all Exchange related PowerShell environments in Microsoft 365. Admins can use Exchange Online PowerShell to disable connectors for an entire tenant or a specific group mailbox. If a connector is disabled, it affects all users in that tenant or mailbox. You cannot disable a connector for a few specific users.

The tenant setting overrides the group setting. For example, if an admin enables connectors for the group and disables them on the tenant, connectors for the group is disabled. To enable a connector in Teams, [connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps#connect-to-exchange-online-powershell-using-modern-authentication-with-or-without-mfa&preserve-view=true) using modern authentication with or without MFA.

To enable or disable a connector, execute the following commands in Exchange Online PowerShell:

* To disable connectors for the tenant: `Set-OrganizationConfig -ConnectorsEnabled:$false`.
* To disable actionable messages for the tenant: `Set-OrganizationConfig -ConnectorsActionableMessagesEnabled:$false`.
* To enable connectors for Teams, execute the following commands:
  * `Set-OrganizationConfig -ConnectorsEnabled:$true`
  * `Set-OrganizationConfig -ConnectorsEnabledForTeams:$true`
  * `Set-OrganizationConfig -ConnectorsActionableMessagesEnabled:$true`

For more information on PowerShell module exchange, see [Set-OrganizationConfig](/powershell/module/exchange/Set-OrganizationConfig?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true). To enable or disable Outlook connectors, [connect apps to your groups in Microsoft Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/connect-apps-to-your-groups-in-outlook-ed0ce547-038f-4902-b9b3-9e518ae6fbab).

## Publish connectors for your organization

To make a custom connector available to your organization's users, upload a custom connector app to your org's app catalog. End-users within the org can install, configure, and use the connector in a team.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Custom connectors are not available in Government Community Cloud (GCC), Government Community Cloud-High (GCCH), and Department of Defense (DOD) environments.

To use connectors in a team or a channel, open the More Options menu from the upper right corner of a channel. From the menu, select **Connectors** and then locate or search for the required connector. Configure the selected connector if necessary.

* Jenkins connector is scheduled for release on Feb 28, 2023.

## Update URL of a connector

The Teams connectors are transitioning to a new URL to enhance security. During transition, you'll receive a notification to update the configured connector. Update your connector at the earliest to prevent any disruption to connector services. To update your connector:

1. In the connectors configuration page, check for **Attention Required** message next to the configured connector.

   :::image type="content" source="media/teams-attention-required-message.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Attention Required message.":::

1. To recreate the connection for incoming webhook connectors, select **Update URL** and use the generated webhook URL.

   :::image type="content" source="media/teams-update-url-option.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Update URL button.":::

1. For other connector types, remove the connector and recreate the connector configuration. A **URL is up-to-date** message appears.
